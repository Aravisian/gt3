gt3EX-GTK

GT3 and similar series were originally conceived of, designed and created by Tiggz on Wincustomize.
Hailed by many as "ahead of his time," this shows in the quality of his work, along with the timeless elegance of it.
This is a recreation for Linux Desktops bringing many elements forward to 2022 - fashioned primarily in .css.
Sporting the WhiskerMenu, you can see this in XFCE4.16. Theme includes a Cinnamon Desktop, as well. Good for you Mint users, as well as Zorin OS.
If you like, you can use the included "transparency.png" or "mint-menu-icon.png" as your custom App Menu Icon to render them invisible, just as done with the Azenis2021 theme.
I inset the tabs to more closely reflect the depth that GT3 had, along with three different button designs.

I am sure if Tiggz were to see this today, he would say, "huh... That's reasonably adequate. For an amateur."

Sporting the Antares Icons - because they fit the theme pretty nicely, really.
